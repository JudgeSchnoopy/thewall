This game is being designed by Jeff Golden, February 15 2018.

This is a copy of the TV show 'The Wall' on NBC.

The game is being designed for Jeff's son, Samuel Golden, who loves the Wall so much he needs a version to play at home.

The game will be designed to play on a monitor, using a custom controller with buttons A,B,C,D.  The controller will be attached directly to the Pi.

dogit = add, commit, push
